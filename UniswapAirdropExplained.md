# Uniswap Airdrop

## What Happened

Anyone who used Uniswap at least once have received 400 UNI tokens. 💸

That means that anyone who attended one of our Hands-on workshops might have received these tokens. 🥳

The Crypto Kitchen team has decided to reach out to each person who participated in these workshops to help them get these tokens. 🤓

## What We Ask From You

We run these workshops for free or almost so as a thank you note for our work in getting everyone to try Uniswap and the follow up work for claiming the tokens we ask you to give at least 10% of your UNI tokens to our organization. 🙏🏼

These funds will go to the wallet of the Crypto Kitchen and will help us run more events, we will also spend a good part of the funds to support Akasha Hub without whom this would have not been possible. We think maybe some nice kitchen ware 😉
