# Crypto Kitchen

## Why Should You Care?
Because we started this project for fun, got so much positive feedback and fun that we cannot stop 🙃
We love the blockchain space and do our best to share our passion and knowledge the way we wish we could have learned about it ourselves 🤓

## What We Do
We facilitate workshops for **audiences of all levels** while casually sharing food and drinks during or after the event 🍹
We create a space that is cozy and friendly so that everyone feels comfortable to share her/his experiences and ask any question 🤗 
We keep in touch after the event, digitally via chat groups and physically via running more events. 👥👥

## Food and Crypto?
Yes ma'am! 🥑🍎🍩 Do not underestimate the power of the kitchen! ✊

## History
This project was started for fun in Barcelona in **Feb 2020** at **Akasha Hub** by Igor Line, Ludo Bret and Adrien Berthou. The same crew who leads the **Barcelona Blockchain Love meetup group**. ☀️ Note that it was started out of frustration of having so many blockchain event attendants who had never used basic tools such as Metamask.🤨
