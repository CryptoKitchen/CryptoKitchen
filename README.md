# Crypto Kitchen

## Food and Crypto?
Yes ma'am! 🥑🍎🍩 Do not underestimate the power of the kitchen! 💪

## Why Should You Care?
Because we started this project for fun, got so much positive feedback and fun that we cannot stop 🙃
We love the blockchain space and do our best to share our passion and knowledge the way we wish we could have learned about it ourselves 🤓
We believe in grassroots movements and hope every event we facilitate helps the whole ecosystem mature by educating individuals who actually use the web3 tools of tomorrow and invest in the future of the internet ✊

## What We Do
We facilitate workshops for **audiences of all levels** while casually sharing food and drinks during or after the event 🍹
We create a space that is cozy and friendly so that everyone feels comfortable to share her/his experiences and ask any question 🤗 
We keep in touch after the event, digitally via chat groups and physically via running more events. 👥👥

Please help us spread the knowledge, the more educated people will be, the less shitcoins on the planets! 
We are strong blockchain ecologists fighting for a clean ecosystem 🌎 
Else what will we be left for our children and grand children? 👶
Joke apart, we believe open source is one very core component of what makes blockchain and interent what it is today so we stick to that too.

## History
This project was started for fun in Barcelona in **Feb 2020** at **Akasha Hub** by Igor Line, Ludo Bret and Adrien Berthou. The same crew who leads the **Barcelona Blockchain Love meetup group**. ☀️ Note that it was started out of frustration of having so many blockchain event attendants who had never used basic tools such as Metamask.🤨
