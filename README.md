Joke apart, we believe open source is one very core component of what makes blockchain and interent what it is today so we stick to that too.

## History
This project was started for fun in Barcelona in **Feb 2020** at **Akasha Hub** by Igor Line, Ludo Bret and Adrien Berthou. The same crew who leads the **Barcelona Blockchain Love meetup group**.

Note that it all started out of frustration of having so many blockchain event attendants who had never used basic tools such as Metamask.🤨
